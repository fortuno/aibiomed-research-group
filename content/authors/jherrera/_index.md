My research field covers the study of machine learning techniques (deep learning, feature selection,
soft-computing, etc.), their optimization using high performance computing systems and their application
over a wide range of scientific problems related to classification, approximation and time seriesprediction. These applications include relevant problems in bioinformatics and biomedicine, among
others (such as dentistry, biochemistry, physics, time series prediction, etc.).

As a result of the carried-out research, I have published over 67 journal papers indexed in the Journal
Citation Reports of the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI). These journals Computers in Biology and
Medicine, Current Bioinformatics, IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, BMC
Bioinformatics, PLOS ONE, Neural Computing and Applications, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, International
Journal of Neural Systems, Nerocomputing, Applied Optics, International Journal of Forecasting, Dental
Materials, Scientific Reports, among others) are a reference in the research areas mentioned above. In
a complementary way, I have participated in several international conferences related to my research
scope, attaining three best paper awards.

I have participated in several research projects with continuity since the beginning of my research
career. The funding entities correspond to the Spanish Ministry, the regional Junta de Andalucía
Government funding programs, the University of Granada local programs and one European Project.
Among these, I have been the main researcher (together with Ignacio Rojas) of three National R&D+I
Plan in the 2015, 2018 and 2021 calls, being the first two ones positively evaluated, and being the third
one in progress. I have similarly been main researcher in other competitive calls in three University of
Granada calls: CEI-BIOTIC Campus de Excelencia Internacional BioTic Granada –2013-, and "Granada
Excellence Network of Innovation Laboratories" –GENIL-2011 and 2014-, all positively evaluated. All of
these projects led to the dissemination of relevant results in JCR journals and international conferences.

I have continuously been carrying out interdisciplinary works with researchers from other areas such as
Optics, Odontology, Applied Physics, Marketing (among others) since the end of my PhD, obtaining an
important number of publications, and a number of international prices. It is to be highlighted that I have
led a relevant number of interdisciplinary research works with these groups, achieving high-impact
journal publications and attaining specific funding in the form of local projects and contracts with the
private sector.

I have been editor of proceedings of national and international conferences (SICO’2010, IWBBIO’2017-
2024, ITISE’2020-24, BIOMESIP’2021), and I am co-author of a number of book chapters in national
and international editorials. I have also contributed to the knowledge transfer to the productive sector
through the participation in six R&D contracts with international companies.

I have supervised six PhD thesis, all of them producing a number of high-impact journal publications.
Three of these researchers are working now as university lecturers, and three are working as post-doc
researchers one in a private company, and the other two in international research centers. Besides, I
am currently supervising another PhD student, under public (one research contract) funding. Besides, I
have obtained two national youth guarantee contract for two years for graduate students. I have also
supervised a large number of master thesis, with a considerable number of them subsequently
publishing conference or journal papers. I have performed revision tasks of private company R&D
projects, as well as a large number of journal paper review tasks.

Finally, I have performed four research stays in research centers in Germany, Belgium, United Kingdom,
and Netherlands with satisfactory results and reflected in publications in conferences proceedings.
Other merits include the performance as editorial board of three international journals in my career and
the organization of special sessions and participation as program committee in a number of scientific
meetings/conferences.
