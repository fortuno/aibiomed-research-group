My research field covers the study of machine learning techniques (deep learning, feature selection, soft-computing, etc.), their optimization using high performance computing systems and their application over a wide range of scientific problems related to classification, approximation and time series prediction. These applications include relevant problems in bioinformatics and biomedicine, among others (such as biochemistry, physics, time series prediction, etc.).

As a result of the carried-out research, I have published over 62 journal papers indexed in the Journal Citation Reports of the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI). These journals Computers in Biology and Medicine, Current Bioinformatics, IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, BMC
Bioinformatics, PLOS ONE, Neural Computing and Applications, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, International Journal of Neural Systems, Nerocomputing, Applied Optics, International Journal of Forecasting, Dental Materials, Scientific Reports, among others) are a reference in the research areas mentioned above. In a complementary way, I have participated in several international conferences related to my research scope, attaining three best paper awards.

I have participated in several research projects with continuity since the beginning of my research career. The funding entities correspond to the Spanish Ministry, the regional Junta de Andalucía Government funding programs, the University of Granada local programs and one European Project. Among these, I have been the main researcher (together with Ignacio Rojas) of two National R&D+I Plan in the 2015 and 2018 call (and of one project starting this year from the 2021 call), being the first one positively evaluated, and being the second one just finished. I have similarly been main researcher in other competitive calls in three University of Granada calls: CEI-BIOTIC Campus de Excelencia Internacional BioTic Granada –2013-, and "Granada Excellence Network of Innovation Laboratories" –GENIL-2011 and 2014-, all positively evaluated. All of these projects led to the dissemination of relevant results in JCR journals and international conferences.

I have continuously been carrying out interdisciplinary works with researchers from other areas such as Optics, Odontology, Applied Physics, Marketing (among others) since the end of my PhD, obtaining an important number of publications, and a number of international prices. It is to be highlighted that I have led a relevant number of interdisciplinary research works with these groups, achieving high-impact journal publications and attaining specific funding in the form of local projects and contracts with the private sector.

I have been editor of proceedings of national and international conferences (SICO’2010, IWBBIO’2017, ITISE’2020-21-22, IWBBIO’2020-22, BIOMESIP’2021), and I am co-author of a number of book chapters in national and international editorials. I have also contributed to the knowledge transfer to the productive sector through the participation in five R&D contracts with international companies. 

I have supervised four PhD thesis, all of them producing a number of high-impact journal publications. Two of these researchers are working now as university lecturers, and one of them is working in a postdoc research position in an international research center. Besides, I am currently supervising three PhD students, all under public or private (one research contract) funding, two of them having already published a number of JCR journal papers as first authors. Besides, I have obtained a national youth guarantee contract for two years for a graduate student. I have also supervised a large number of master thesis, with a considerable number of them subsequently publishing conference or journal papers. I have performed revision tasks of private company R&D projects, as well as a large number of journal paper review tasks.

Finally, I have performed three research stays in research centers in Germany, Belgium and United Kingdom, with satisfactory results and reflected in publications in conferences proceedings. Other merits include the performance as editorial board of three international journals in my career and the organization of special sessions and participation as program committee in a number of scientific meetings/conferences.
