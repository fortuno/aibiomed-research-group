Alberto Guillén Perales started his academic career in 1997 starting the studies of Ingeniería Informática (Computer Science and Engineering) and finishing them in 2002. Afterwards he starting working in a company until 2004 when he was granted a scholarship for Research Personnel Formation (FPI) by the Junta de Andalucia. He started his PhD which was obtained in 2007 by the University of Granada at the Computer Technology and Architecture Department. During this time at college he spent one year at the University of California (Irvine) where he worked for the Computing Services and during the PhD, he spent 6 months in Edinburgh collaborating with the University of Edinburgh and the Napier University. Afterwards he has collaborated with the School of Computing at the Aalto University (Finland) (previously know as TKK) with the professor Amaury Lendasse, and recently he has started a collaboration with the Laboratório de Instrumentaçao e física experimental de Particulas (LIP) with its director Mario Pimenta.

During his research activity, he has a prolific publishing record in prestigious journals and conferences. The main topics have been soft computing and machine learning, focusing in the variable selection problem and in the application of these methodologies to real life problems. This has led the researcher to participate in many projects and to be the Principal Investigator in several projects.

Regarding teaching experience, the researcher has been full time teacher since 2006 until nowadays. He started at the University of Jaén teaching Computer Technology at the Telecommunications degree. In 2009 he obtained a temporal position at the University of Granada teaching in several courses for the Computer Science and Telecommunications Degrees and he is a current professor in two Master's degree. He was the coordinator of the master for teaching at high school for the first three years. He has supervised many Master Thesis and three PhD Thesis.

Finally, the relationship with companies have been an interest of the researcher that currently is exploiting the know-how through two spin-off companies related to social networks and intelligent learning.
