I am Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Engineering, Automatics and Robotics at the University of Granada. I have been also working as Cancer Genomics Researcher at the Clinical Bioinformatics Area of the Fundacion Progreso y Saludo (FPS) in Seville (Spain) during 3 years as well as Senior Bioinformatics at Center for Data Intensive Science in the University of Chicago (USA) during 2.5 years.

My research is focused on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. I'm specialized on the implementation of several heuristics and computational algorithms for the integration, prediction and classification associated to biological procedures in genomics and proteomics. Among the implemented algorithms, I have used supervised learning methods, such as SVMs and LS-SVMs, genetic algorithms or multiobjective approaches. Specifically, I have applied these techniques in bioinformatic areas like multiple sequence alignments, microarray data analysis, biomedical data mining and protein-protein interactions (PPIs).

I have participated in several Spanish research projects such as DSIPA-BIO, HPC-BIO or ADA-BIO. I have been a visiting researcher in the Computational Biology and Data Mining Group of the Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC) in Berlin (Germany). During my period in the University of Chicago, I have been involved in the development and data analysis of several data commons for genomics and clinical data sharing: GDC (Genomics Data Commons), BloodPAC (Blood Profile Atlas Consortium), GenoMEL (Genomics MELanoma).

I have also co-organized the International Work-Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering (IWBBIO) since 2013, being also Editor of the proceedings book and Guest Editor in the corresponding special issues in the Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling, Biomedical Engineering Online and Current Bioinformatics journals.
