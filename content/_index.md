        Welcome to Artificial Intelligence, Bionformatics & Biomedicine (AIBioMed) Group, part of the Department of Computer Engineering, Automatics and Robotics (ICAR) of the University of Granada (UGR). The AIBioMed group focuses on discovering artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions for a diverse range of bioinformatics and biomedical problems. We are interested on dealing with Big Data from biological and biomedical fields, including genomics, medical imaging or clinical data, amongs others. Together with clinical collaborators, we aim to find new relevant biomarkers from huge amounts of data that can improve prognosis, diagnosis and treatments, that seeking for a more realistic personalized medicine and significantly impacting the quality of life in patients. Among our implemented and published algorithms, we have long expertise on both regression and classification machine learning solutions, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms or deep learning solutions like generative or diffusion models.
